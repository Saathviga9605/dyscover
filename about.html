        <h2>What is Dyslexia?</h2>
        <p>Dyslexia is a learning disability that primarily affects reading and related language-based skills. It's characterized by difficulties with accurate and fluent word recognition, poor spelling, and related difficulties with reading comprehension.</p>
        <p>Dyslexia is like trying to play a word game where the letters dance around and never stay still. Imagine reading a sentence, but the words keep jumbling or flipping. That’s how it feels to someone with dyslexia—frustrating, confusing, but not impossible!</p>

        <h2>What Causes It?</h2>
        <p>Dyslexia is primarily believed to stem from differences in how the brain processes language and reading. While the exact cause remains unknown, research suggests a strong genetic component, with dyslexia often running in families. Differences in brain structure and function related to language processing are also thought to play a role. Additionally, risk factors like low birth weight, premature birth, and exposure to certain substances during gestation can increase the likelihood of developing dyslexia.</p>
        <p>Dyslexia isn’t about being lazy or not trying. It’s a brain-based difference in how people process language. It can run in families and sometimes just happens randomly. But with the right tools and support, every dyslexic child can thrive.</p>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
  We’re just two third-year students who believe that technology should do more than just impress — it should <strong>heal</strong>, <strong>empower</strong>, and <strong>uplift</strong>. This project isn’t just another college assignment. It’s a piece of our hearts, built out of late-night conversations, shared dreams, and a fierce desire to <em>make the world a little easier</em> for those often misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
  We’ve poured our soul into building a space where every child, regardless of how they read or write, feels seen, supported, and celebrated.
</p>
<p>
  This isn’t just tech.<br>
  This is <em>hope, gamified.</em><br>
  This is <em>compassion, coded line by line.</em><br>
  And we're just getting started.
